# Zero-Shot test

This part of the repository has two zero-shot tests: [Chronos](https://assets.amazon.science/1c/b5/1ec660274e52ac843a988c6065dc/chronos-learning-the-language-of-time-series.pdf) which was updated with their bolt framework and [Moirai](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Yd8eHMY1wz) and one recent update [Moirai-moe](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.10469)

Each notebook uses 1 model and test on all benchmark data sets.
